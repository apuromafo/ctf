Follow your common sense You cannot hide yourself

Follow your common sense You cannot hide yourself behind a fairytale 

forever and ever Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose The soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever 

Forever and ever Indoctrinated minds so very often contain sick thoughts And commit most of the evil they preach against 

Don't try to convince me with messages from God You accuse us of sins committed by yourselves It's easy to condemn without looking in the 

mirror Behind the scenes opens reality Eternal silence cries out for justice Forgiveness is not for sale Nor is the will to forget 

Follow your common sense You cannot hide yourself behind a fairytale forever and ever Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose 

The soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever Forever and ever Virginity has been stolen at very young ages 

And the extinguisher loses it's immunity Morbid abuse of power in the garden of Eden Where the apple gets a youthful face 

Eternal silence cries out for justice Forgiveness is not for sale Nor is the will to forget
